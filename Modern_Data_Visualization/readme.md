## Dataset

> The dataset used is Ford-gobike public dataset. Not all the data was used, instead, just the first 6 months of the year 2018 as part of this analysis. 

## Summary of Findings

> There was some interesting relations betwen the features, some were intuitive and others were odd.
* The First note was that the bikes dependency is very minor and the distance traveled is whithin 2 km range, which is intruging and will be used in the explanatory slides.
* Secondly, most members use their bikes for less than 5 minutes which reflects the over-dependency on the bikes even for small walks.
* thirdly,  There were some outliers in the data that were removed and, hence, provided a better visualization for the data. 
* Fourthly, It seems that the customers are the most overwhelming category of users. It is not obvious if it is preferable for the company or not, but it should be considered.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> * Group type is a very promising feature for insights, so, most figures are including this feature, coloring, hue, and labels should be added to better visualize the graphs.
* Males aren't the only point of interest, but also females, and the data suggests some behavioral difference in both genders. I beleive that adding them to some relations will extract more insights.
